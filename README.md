# LLVM for Windows

LLVM is a little bit tricky to use on a Windows Environment.
My intention is to compile C-Code to IR Code and IR Code to Executables just with the CLI.
I want to share my experience and precompiled tools with you to reduce the pain with LLVM on Windows.

Visual Studio has an experimental Clang/LLVM Support but that's a different story.
